Using setTimeout to implement setInterval

(function(){ var a = b = 3; })()
console.log(a)
console.log(b)

What will a and b print

var myObject = {
    foo: "bar",
    func: function() {
        var self = this;
        console.log("outer func:  this.foo = " + this.foo);
        console.log("outer func:  self.foo = " + self.foo);
        (function() {
            console.log("inner func:  this.foo = " + this.foo);
            console.log("inner func:  self.foo = " + self.foo);
        }());
    }
};
myObject.func();
Above console.log value output

(function(x) {
    return (function(y) {
        console.log(x);
    })(2)
})(1);
Output the above

(function () {
    try {
        throw new Error();
    } catch (x) {
        var x = 1, y = 2;
        console.log(x);
    }
    console.log(x);
    console.log(y);
})();
Output the console above

var trees = ["xyz","xxxx","test","ryan","apple"];
delete trees[3];
   
console.log(trees.length);
var b = 1;
function outer(){
    var b = 2
    function inner(){
        b++;
        var b = 3;
        console.log(b)
    }
    inner();
}
outer();

=== Implement currying

Question: 
function sum (a, b) {
return a + b;
}

var currySum = currier(sum);
currySum(2, 3) // should return 5
currySum(2)(3) // should also return 5

Solution: https://medium.com/@kevincennis/currying-in-javascript-c66080543528



=== Implement Array Native Methods
Ex - Implement Array.flatten

Question:

var arr = [[1], [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]];
flatten(arr) => // should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];





Create a function getHexagonCoordinates which will accept 3 parameters x,y and numberOfRings. This function will return coordinates of all the hexagons. Use this function to create all the hexagon ring.

Example with 3 rings





Make a restaurant finder using zomato and google Maps API
- The UI should accept the location of the User as input, you should provide options for taking the location of the user or a text input
- Zomato provides api for the best restaurants around based on location
- The restaurants location should be overlayed on top of Google Maps along with the users location'
- Rest of the UI is up to you. But should provide basic info like 
  - Cuisine
  - Price Range
  - Some Pics
  - Online Delivery?
  - Booking URL etc
  - Reviews/Ratings
